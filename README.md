# Depictio

## Project Overview

Depictio is an innovative web-based platform currently under development, aimed at facilitating downstream analysis in bioinformatics. It provides a dynamic and interactive dashboard experience for quality control (QC) metrics monitoring and result exploration in genomic studies. The platform is tailored towards large-scale studies and research facilities, offering support for various data formats and interactive data visualization tools.

## Features

* Dynamic Dashboards: Real-time data interaction, customizable views, and user-driven exploration features.
* Diverse Data Format Support: Handles standard formats like CSV, TSV, XLSX, Parquet, and specialized genomic files like BED, BigBed, BigWig, BAM/CRAM, VCF.
* AI-Assisted Dashboard Generation: Future plans include implementing AI templates for automatic data-driven dashboard creation.
* Robust Backend Technologies: Utilizes FastAPI, MongoDB, and Redis cache for high-performance data management and processing.
* Intuitive Frontend: Built on Plotly Dash, a ReactJS-based framework, complemented by visualization tools like JBrowse and Cytoscape.

## Development Status

Depictio is currently in the development phase and is not yet available for general use. The platform is being built with an emphasis on versatility and adaptability to various biological research needs.

## Biological Use-Cases

Depictio is currently being developed with two primary workflows employed as use-cases :

* Single-cell Structural Variations from Strand-seq data: Focus on cancer subclonal characterisation and genome phasing.
* Diatom Interactions and Climate Change Studies: Analysis of diatom symbioses in marine biology, in collaboration with the Vincent group and TREC.

## Contributing

While Depictio is not yet operational, we welcome ideas, suggestions, and feedback from the community. If you have insights or want to contribute to the project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
