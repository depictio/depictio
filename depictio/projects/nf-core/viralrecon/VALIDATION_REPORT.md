# nf-core/viralrecon 3.0.0 — Template Ingestion Validation Report

**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Branch:** `chore/amplicon-viralrecon-validation`
**Validator:** local depictio-cli (`depictio/cli/.venv`, v1.0.1) against the local docker stack
(instance `chore-amplicon-viralrecon-validation-100`, API `:8100`, MinIO `:9100`, Mongo `:27100`).

## Goal

Drive `depictio-cli run --template nf-core/viralrecon/3.0.0` against **real** nf-core/viralrecon
pipeline output across scenarios and find every place the template breaks. Companion to the ampliseq
report (`depictio/projects/nf-core/ampliseq/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`).

## Data used

The viralrecon template uses `data_location.structure: "sequencing-runs"` (`runs_regex: "run_.*"`),
so `DATA_ROOT` is the **parent** of the per-run directories.

| Scenario | DATA_ROOT | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| VR-S1 | `~/Data/depictio-nfcore/viralrecon/3.0.0/` (parent of both runs) | Multi-run aggregation: `run_illumina_amplicon` (complete ivar amplicon) + `run_nanopore` (divergent artic/medaka) |
| VR-S2 | a parent containing only `run_nanopore` | Divergent protocol alone (out-of-scope for this ivar template) |

```bash
depictio-cli run --CLI-config-path ~/.depictio/CLI.<instance>.yaml \
  --template nf-core/viralrecon/3.0.0 \
  --data-root ~/Data/depictio-nfcore/viralrecon/3.0.0 --overwrite --update-config
```

## Starting point — viralrecon is a much cleaner template than ampliseq

No path / format / variable discrepancies were found (contrast with ampliseq D1–D5):
- Only `DATA_ROOT` is required; no `reference.vars`, no required file-path vars, no metadata-column
  coupling.
- mosdepth DCs declare `format: "TSV"` and the files are genuinely tab-separated — they parse
  correctly (the D3 extension-based separator fix from the ampliseq pass also covers them).
- `summary_metrics`, `mosdepth_amplicon_coverage/genome_coverage/amplicon_heatmap`, and the
  `complex_heatmap`/`coverage_track` canonicals all ingest correctly with real row counts.

## VR-S1 result: 7 / 14 data collections processed, 7 skipped-optional, exit 0

**Processed OK (7):** `multiqc_data`, `summary_metrics` (3 samples), `mosdepth_amplicon_coverage`
(294 rows), `mosdepth_genome_coverage` (450 rows), `mosdepth_amplicon_heatmap`,
`complex_heatmap_canonical` (6×101), `coverage_track_canonical` (900 rows).

**Skipped-optional (7):** see VR-D1.

The `run_nanopore` directory was scanned (2/2 runs) but matched none of the ivar/mosdepth/multiqc
globs, so it contributed nothing without error — graceful multi-run handling.

## Discrepancies

### VR-D1 — SARS-CoV-2 lineage/variant DCs hard-fail when their outputs are absent  ✅ FIXED (skip)
- The illumina test run has `skip_pangolin=false`, `skip_nextclade=false`,
  `skip_variants_long_table=false`, yet produced **no** `variants/ivar/variants_long_table.csv`, no
  `*.pangolin.csv`, and no nextclade output — the synthetic test consensus is too poor to yield
  lineage/variant calls (only the pangolin **database** dir exists, no result CSV).
- Before the fix these 7 DCs hard-failed and the run exited 1:
  - base: `variants_long` (`variants/ivar/variants_long_table.csv`), `pangolin_lineages`
    (`*.pangolin.csv`), `nextclade_results` (nextclade `*.csv`)
  - canonical (cascade via `dc_ref`): `oncoplot_canonical`, `upset_canonical`,
    `variant_feature_matrix_canonical` (→ `variants_long`), `sankey_canonical`
    (→ `pangolin_lineages` + `nextclade_results`)
- These are **real** viralrecon outputs that are legitimately absent on poor-quality test data,
  non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens (HIV/EV produce no pangolin/nextclade), or with `--skip_*` flags — i.e. the
  classic graceful-DC-handling case.
- **Fix applied:** marked all 7 DCs `optional: true` in `template.yaml`. Combined with the CLI
  graceful-skip added in the ampliseq pass (`process.py`), a run lacking these outputs now ingests
  what it has and **skips** the rest. Re-verified VR-S1: 7 processed, 7 skipped, 0 failures, exit 0.
  A complete SARS-CoV-2 run still ingests them normally (the skip only triggers on absent inputs).

### VR-D2 — Divergent nanopore-only run fails loudly (correct, not softened)  — VR-S2
- Pointing `DATA_ROOT` at a parent containing only `run_nanopore` (artic/medaka — no
  multiqc/variants/mosdepth) fails at processing: the **non-optional** core DCs `multiqc_data`,
  `summary_metrics`, `mosdepth_*` have no data → **exit 1** with clear messages.
- This is the **correct** outcome: the template is explicitly "designed for nf-core/viralrecon
  amplicon (ivar) workflow outputs", so a nanopore/artic run is out of scope and should fail loudly
  rather than silently create an empty project. The lineage/variant DCs skip gracefully (VR-D1); the
  core QC DCs remain required. Not softened.

## Generic CLI fixes (from the ampliseq pass) that also benefit viralrecon
- **D9** non-zero exit on DC/step failure — VR-S1 (pre-fix) and VR-S2 both correctly return exit 1
  when DCs fail.
- **D6** optional-DC graceful skip in `cli/utils/process.py` — the mechanism VR-D1 relies on.
- **D8** `plotly` declared as a CLI dependency.
- **D3** extension-based separator detection — covers the mosdepth TSVs.

## Final scenario status (after fix)
- **VR-S1** (multi-run, illumina + nanopore): 7 processed, 7 skipped-optional, 0 failures, **exit 0**.
- **VR-S2** (nanopore-only, out-of-scope): core DCs fail loudly, **exit 1** (correct).

## Changes made for viralrecon
- `template.yaml`: marked 7 data-dependent DCs `optional: true` (VR-D1). No CLI code changes were
  needed — the ampliseq-pass CLI fixes already cover viralrecon.

## Self-adapting dashboards + non-SARS/nanopore (Layer 1 + Layer 2)

The shared Layer 1 import-time hiding (`_filter_unresolved_components`) + the mosdepth-derived DCs
also marked `optional` (`mosdepth_amplicon_coverage/genome_coverage/amplicon_heatmap`,
`complex_heatmap_canonical`, `coverage_track_canonical`) make non-SARS / poor-consensus runs
self-adapt: components/tabs without data are hidden, the rest render. `summary_metrics` + `multiqc`
stay **required** as the safety net.

### Final 5-run matrix (self-adapting)
| Run | Exit | Outcome |
|-----|------|---------|
| `run_amplicon_custom` (full SARS) | 0 | full dashboard — all 13 DCs populated |
| `run_illumina_amplicon` (SARS, poor consensus) | 0 | Lineage & Variants tabs hidden (no lineage/variant data); Coverage + Sample-QC + MultiQC kept |
| `run_hiv` (non-SARS metagenomic) | 0 | MultiQC + Coverage (genome only) + Sample-QC; lineage/amplicon tabs hidden |
| `run_ev` (non-SARS metagenomic) | 0 | MultiQC + summary_metrics; coverage/lineage hidden |
| `run_nanopore` (artic/medaka) | 1 | **out of scope** — ARTIC produces none of the ivar/mosdepth outputs and no `summary_variants_metrics_mqc.csv`; fails loud (a curated nanopore view needs new `artic_minion/` DCs) |

Note: `summary_metrics`/`multiqc` are deliberately **not** optional, so `run_nanopore` fails loudly
rather than silently producing an empty project — the honest signal that this ivar template doesn't
fit an ARTIC run.

## Dashboard-review pass (2026-06-18)

Live review of each per-run dashboard in the dev stack, fixing rendering/layout rough edges. The
engine-level fixes are shared with ampliseq (see that report); viralrecon-specific notes:

### Enterovirus (`run_ev`) renders empty — expected, the test dataset is degenerate
The EV dashboard showing "everything empty or at 0" is **not** a bug. The nf-core run itself produced
almost no data:
- `pipeline_info/params*.json` has `"primer_set": null` → the pipeline runs in **whole-genome /
  metagenomic mode**, not amplicon mode, so **no `variants/bowtie2/mosdepth/` directory is produced**
  (contrast `run_illumina_amplicon`, which has amplicon + genome mosdepth TSVs with 450+ rows).
- Only **~4.6 %** of reads map to the reference (759 / 20 000); `summary_variants_metrics_mqc.csv`
  carries a single sample with coverage median / coverage-≥10x / variant counts all `NA`.
- With no depth there is nothing for mosdepth, ivar, or consensus to emit.

Decision: handle gracefully + document, do **not** fabricate data. The self-adapting layout work
(below) lets the EV dashboard render cleanly — empty/degraded components and tabs drop out instead of
showing error cards or half-empty rows. If a meaningful EV validation is wanted later, it needs a
test dataset that actually maps and calls variants (a new nf-core run), not a template change.

### Self-adapting layout — no orphaned half-width cards, minimum-useful tabs
Shared engine fixes (in `depictio/api/v1/endpoints/dashboards_endpoints/routes.py` and the React
`DashboardGrid.tsx`) address the HIV / Illumina "median-coverage card alone on a row", the HIV
Coverage "genome-coverage card alone + no filters", and the HIV/nanopore MultiQC orphaning:
- **`_recompact_main_grid`** re-packs the main grid after components are dropped, widening any card
  left alone on a row so dropped plots/cards never leave a half-empty row; the React
  `widenLoneRows` pass mirrors this for layouts already stored / hidden only at render.
- **`_tab_meets_minimum`** enforces the mandatory minimum: every surviving tab keeps **≥1 filter
  AND ≥1 non-metadata visualisation**. A tab reduced below that (e.g. nanopore Sample-QC once its
  `summary_metrics`-bound components are gone) is dropped.

### Mandatory per-tab filter — MultiQC-DC sample filter
Every tab (incl. the never-dropped **main MultiQC tab**) must carry a working filter on every route.
The main tab's sample filter previously bound to `summary_metrics`, which is pruned on genome-only /
nanopore runs, leaving the tab filter-less. Fix:
- `GET /deltatables/unique_values/{dc}` now serves a MultiQC DC's sample list (from the ingested
  `canonical_samples`) instead of querying a (non-existent) Delta table.
- The main-tab sample filter is rebound to the always-present `multiqc_data` DC; the picked sample is
  expanded to its per-report variants by `_resolve_multiqc_sample_filter`. Verified: nanopore / HIV /
  enterovirus main tabs now carry a populated `multiqc_data/sample` filter.

## Template overhaul (2026-06-24)

Three changes supersede the nanopore + naming notes above (VR-D2 / VR-S2 / "out of scope"):

### `PLATFORM` value variable replaces the `IS_NANOPORE` boolean
The bespoke `IS_NANOPORE` flag became a named `PLATFORM` value (`illumina` default, or
`nanopore`), routed via the new `if_var_equals: {PLATFORM: nanopore}` rule (added to
`TemplateConditional`, alongside a `default` field on `TemplateVariable`). See the
harmonization note below for how it is acquired (auto-derived from `params.json`, overridable).

### Nanopore now keeps variant views (ARTIC) instead of failing out of scope
`PLATFORM=nanopore` no longer drops the variant DCs. It repoints `variants_long` at the
`artic/variants_long.py` catalog recipe (clair3 `*.pass.vcf.gz` → same long-table schema as
ivar), so the variant components and the variant-derived DCs keep working. Only
`summary_metrics` is still dropped (no nanopore summary-metrics recipe yet). The mosdepth /
pangolin / nextclade `artic_minion/` repoints are unchanged.
*Caveat:* `artic/variants_long.py` is still marked UNVALIDATED — verify the VCF/INFO field
parsing against a real nf-core/viralrecon nanopore run before relying on it.

### Canonical DC tags renamed (clarity)
`oncoplot_canonical → variant_oncoplot`, `complex_heatmap_canonical → amplicon_coverage_matrix`,
`coverage_track_canonical → genome_coverage_track`, `sankey_canonical → classification_sankey`,
`upset_canonical → mutation_upset`, `variant_feature_matrix_canonical → variant_pca_matrix`.
Recipe filenames are unchanged (catalog-shared / internal). Updated across `template.yaml`,
`dashboards/base.yaml`, `.db_seeds/*.json`, and `db_init_reference_datasets.py`.

## nf-vocabulary harmonization (2026-06-24)

Both nf-core templates (viralrecon + ampliseq) now mirror nf-core's *own* parameter
vocabulary and derive routing generically from the run's `params.json`:

- **Generic introspection.** `_introspect_pipeline_params` no longer hardcodes per-flag
  branches. For each variable a template declares, it copies the same-named (lower-cased)
  `params.json` value (`PLATFORM`↔`platform`, `SKIP_PANGOLIN`↔`skip_pangolin`,
  `ANCOMBC`↔`ancombc`, …), normalized (bool→`true`/`false`). `setdefault` precedence:
  `--var` > `params.json` > template `default`. Each derived value is logged.
- **viralrecon** declares `PLATFORM`, `PROTOCOL`, `VARIANT_CALLER`, and
  `SKIP_PANGOLIN/NEXTCLADE/VARIANTS/VARIANTS_LONG_TABLE/MOSDEPTH`, all routed via
  `if_var_equals`. `VARIANT_CALLER=bcftools` repoints pangolin/nextclade at
  `variants/bcftools/…` (variants_long is already caller-agnostic); `PROTOCOL=metagenomic`
  drops the amplicon mosdepth trio; each `SKIP_*` drops its DC + dependent canonicals.
- **ampliseq** realigned its bespoke vars to nf names: `SKIP_ANCOM`→`ANCOMBC` (routes on
  `=false`), `IS_MULTIREGION`→`MULTIREGION`, `IS_METAGENOMIC` dropped; `SKIP_QIIME` is now
  declared; all `if_var_present/absent` skip routes became `if_var_equals`. The reference
  seed's surviving-DC set was verified byte-identical (17 DCs) before/after.
- **Init resolver** (`resolve_template_for_init`) now applies template-declared defaults so
  value-routes evaluate consistently during params-less reference seeding.
- **UX:** `depictio run --template … --data-root results/` — nothing else — adapts to
  platform / protocol / caller / any `--skip` combination. `--var` overrides anything.
